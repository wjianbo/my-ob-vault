# What I'm doing NOW

I'm currently working on an iOS app called **Capsule**.
It's a simple to-do/shopping list app that allows you to track your tasks easily.
The app makes it convenient to reuse archived tasks.

Usage:

- Tap a task to mark it as completed.
- Tap an archived task to restore it.
- Long press on a task to enter select mode.


Preparing for my first full marathon.
