###### Thoughts
I do not know why I feel unconfortable to see Chinese or Japanese charactors in sans-serif fonts. But English is OK. Haruki Murakami used to write in English first, then translate back to Japanese. Interesting. Anyway, in this obsibian vault, I will write notes only in English. If I want to write in Chinese, I will write in my blog.
