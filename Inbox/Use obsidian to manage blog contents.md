# Use obsidian to manage blog content 

Before I start using obsidian, I used GitHub Issues to write weekly notes and post them using Actions. In this way I can write in the GitHub app on my iPhone without open my PC.

Now I am using obsidian. It is so powerful that I would like to move everything to it. I will do it in a simple way. Open the content folder as a vault, sync it with my iPhone using `remote save` plugin. I still need to publish on my PC. But publish is the easiest part.
