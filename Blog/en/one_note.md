Mindsets/Principles
===================
0. CHALLENGE
Don't be afraid of taking challenges.
1. FAILURE
Failure is always possible. Be prepared.
2. IMPORTANCE
Is that important?
3. KISS
Keep it simple, stupid!
4. LEARN IN PUBLIC
A blog isn't considered truly public unless it has a sufficient number of readers.
Telegram is better.
5. REPEAT
> If you’re talking about something new or novel, 
you’ll have to repeat yourself for years before you’re heard.
-- 37signals
6. SMALL
Continuously do small things. Take small steps
7. STANDALONE
Don't start challenges like '100 days of xxx' which you never finish. 
Instead, make each task a standalone piece.
