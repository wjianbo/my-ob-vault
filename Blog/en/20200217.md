In *This Is Us*, Jack took a video when Kate was singing. Kate got very angry. Jack said that he just want her to know how beautiful she is in his eyes. After Kate watched that video, she told Jack:

Never stop. Never stop trying to let me know how beautiful I am in your eyes.

This reminds me of a conversation between you and me when you tried medication. You expected me to persuade you. But I didn’t. I just said you can quit if you don’t feel like it.

Now I think maybe I should have tried harder. Maybe I should push you harder to make you do things you actually want to do.

In fact, I had this thought just when I was meditating. I started lately, again, trying to meditate for 15 minutes every night before I sleep.

At that moment my back was a little bit hurting. And then I thought, that is just the point. Meditation is not a comfortable or enjoyable thing. Not always. On the contrary, it is about being uncomfortable, maybe most of the time. Not just the body. It’s a kind of mind training, which makes your mind stronger so that you wouldn’t run away when facing a really uncomfortable situation.

Like I said, meditation is not always comfortable or lovely. Just like our life. What we need to do is to face it. Stay with it. And never stop trying. And I wish we could do it together for the rest of our life.
