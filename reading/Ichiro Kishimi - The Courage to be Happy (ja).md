# Ichiro Kishimi - The Courage to be Happy (ja)

I borrowed this book from the library. I read the author's another book years ago. It seams this one will provide some practical advice. I hope I can be Happy.

When I was a child, I refused to call my father dad. I refused to talk. It took decades to realize that is a kind of revenge. But that was past. The past do not really exist. The real problem is **what I am going to do**.

But just let my take a moment to digest. Revenge is phase 4. Phase 5 is proof of disability. I am afraid I have that problem too. I secretly hope that nobody expects anything from me. The author suggested children in phase 4 or 5 should seek help from the experts. Maybe I should.
